About
-----

`bio-rtd <https://github.com/open-biotech/bio-rtd.git>`_ library is a python library for modeling
residence time distributions (RTD)
of integrated continuous biomanufacturing processes.

**Functionality**

RTD models are based on volumetric flow rate and concentration profile.

Multiple process fluid components can be simulated. One can specify e.g. which components bind to the column,
but (as for now) one cannot specify component specific binding properties.

Implemented unit operations can be simulated one by one. This allows easier workflow
and faster evaluation. However, feedback process controls cannot be build on top
of the model.

For more details check :ref:`Features`.
